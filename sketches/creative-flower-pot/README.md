# creative-flower-pot

![thumbnail](thumbnail.png)

A creative flower pot, based on one I drew for one of my beloved teachers on
Vietnamese Teachers' Day 2019. This 3D version does not yet look exactly what I
drew e.g. the stems were originally drawn more dashed-like. I will try to
improve this as I learn more of three.js.

## Interaction

Drag your left mouse to orbit around the pot. Use your middle mousewheel to zoom
in and out.

## To-do's

- [ ] Animate the flowers
- [ ] Find a better material for the stems and the pot
- [ ] Make the pot more "3D" (currently it has no depth)
- [ ] Prevent flowers from colliding when they are randomly placed
- [ ] Force different geometry when `randomGeometry` is called
