# Wall of Donuts

{% include sketch.html directory="wall-of-donuts" display="big" %}

A wall with donuts sticked on it, because why not?

## Interaction

- Move your mouse to look around.
- Click the light switch (next to the door) or click the light bulb to turn
  the light on and off.
- Click on the door knob to open or close the door.
- Press the D key on your keyboard to toggle debugging mode (by default,
  debugging mode is off).
- While debugging mode is on, press the C key on your keyboard to switch between
  first-person camera view (default) and third-person camera view (which is only
  available when debugging mode is on).

## Acknowledgements

The donuts were made by me using Microsoft's Paint 3D.

Thanks are due to...
