# Town of Miraculous Lathes

{% include spline-project.html directory="town-of-miraculous-lathes" display="big" %}

Made exclusively for [my personal website](https://you-create.github.io). Just
funny-looking lathes in cool gradients. Don't they look like mushrooms?

## Interaction

- Left drag to rotate, right drag to pan
- Mouse scroll for zooming in and out
