# Creative Flower Pot

{% include sketch.html directory="creative-flower-pot" display="big" %}

## Description

On Vietnamese Teachers' Day 2019, I decided to draw a creative flower pot as a
gift to my beloved Creative Thinking teacher. I drew it on a card so the
original flower pot was in 2D. This is my attempt at making a 3D version of it.
It is not yet similar to the original one, but I had fun making it. The flowers
are randomly generated, so sometimes their placement is ugly. That's why the
version I sent to my teacher was not randomly generated but manually coded (you
can see it [here][1]).

## Interaction

Drag your left mouse to orbit around the pot. Use your middle mousewheel to zoom
in and out. Reload the sketch if you are not happy with the placement of the
flowers.
