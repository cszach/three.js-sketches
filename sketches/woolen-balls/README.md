# woolen-balls

Some woolen balls on a porcelain floor that I've created. Lights are (hopefully)
physically correct. Woolen balls look peacefully perhaps.

## To-do's

- [x] Physically correct lights
- [ ] Even more physically correct lights (they don't look right currently)
- [ ] Find better textures (currently-used textures look broken)
- [ ] Find a better material for the floor (?)
