# wall-of-donuts

## To-do's

- [ ] Don't start the experiment until all the donuts are loaded into the scene
- [ ] Physically correct lights and shadows
  - [ ] Physically correct the point light on the ceilling and the external
        light that comes in when the door is opened
  - [ ] Correct shadows
- [ ] Correct dimension and measurements
- [ ] Find a better type of mouse control (what is looked for is something
      similar to `FlyControls`, but just no z-rotation on the camera)

> **Note**: `wall-of-donuts.draft.js` is an attempt to physically correct things
in this sketch, however it currently has several problems.
