## Description

Some woolen balls under some spot lights. Lights and shadows are intended to be
physically correct, but I know they are not. In real-world scale, each of the
woolen balls is 10cm in diameter.

This sketch is going to be removed soon because it fails to be good.

## Interaction

There is an orbit control which you can use by using your computer mouse. Mouse
wheel for zooming in and out, left mouse for orbiting around. Panning is
disabled.
